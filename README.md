# Bike-Rental-Prediction-Machine-Learning-Project
This project focuses on predicting hourly bike rentals using weather and time-based data. The goal was to develop predictive models that could help rental services anticipate demand, optimise operations, and improve customer satisfaction.  

## Tools and Technologies  
- Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)  
- Jupyter Notebook for development and analysis  

## Approach  
1. **Data Preparation**  
   - Cleaned and processed the dataset to handle missing and inconsistent values.  
   - Engineered features such as time of day, day of week, and weather conditions.  

2. **Model Development**  
   - Built both regression and classification models to predict demand.  
   - Tested multiple algorithms including linear regression, decision trees, and random forests.  

3. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Assessed performance using metrics such as RMSE, accuracy, and feature importance.  
   - Identified key predictors of demand, including temperature, weather conditions, and peak hours.  

## Key Outcomes  
- Successfully built models capable of predicting hourly rental demand.  
- Demonstrated the influence of temperature and time-related variables on customer behaviour.  
- Showed how predictive analytics can support resource allocation and improve service efficiency.
